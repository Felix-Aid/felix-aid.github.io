Customer churn is a critical issue for many businesses, especially in telecom. Losing customers means losing revenue â€” but what if we could **predict churn before it happens**?

That inspired me to build a **Customer Churn Prediction App** using:
- âœ… Python & Scikit-learn
- âœ… Streamlit for the interface
- âœ… SHAP for explainable AI insights

The app allows users to upload customer data, predict churn, and visualize which features influenced the prediction.

This project helped me deepen my understanding of ML model deployment, explainability, and building user-friendly tools.

Thanks for reading!
