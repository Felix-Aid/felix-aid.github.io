In this blog post, I walk you through the development of a Customer Churn Prediction App that uses machine learning and SHAP explainability.

The app allows users to upload customer data, predict churn likelihood, and visually interpret model decisions using SHAP plots. Built with Python, Streamlit, and Random Forest, it emphasizes both performance and interpretability.
